This is an intermediate-to-advanced programming project that focuses on using best practices and a clean code structure utilizing native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project Focus

Quality Responsive Design: Emphasis on using CSS Grid and Flexbox to build complex layouts that work perfectly across different screen sizes.

Efficient DOM Manipulation: Practices for efficiently manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM), preventing performance bottlenecks.

Clean and Commented Code: Prioritization of code readability by following clear naming conventions and useful comments.

Technologies Used
We work with the fundamental web technologies:

Structure: Semantic HTML5.
